## Summary of Findings

In conclusion we investigated that even tough more trips are taken during weekdays, trips tken on weekends are longer. Numbers are higher on rush hours which might mean that people are using the system to get to work or school.

Also as side observations, subscribers has much more trips then customers. Males has the most trip counts. But their trip durations are shorter then any other genders.
